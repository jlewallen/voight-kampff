Inspired by the robotic testing system from "Do Andoirds Dream of Electric Sheep", this small discord bot sits around and accomplishes some simple commands.

To install, it's important to have a python file called `lorem.py` which has the following variables defined as string literals:
* `discord_token` - Api key given by discord
* ~~`wunder_token` - wunderground weather token~~ **Deprecated due to API closing**
* `location_token` - Using *locationiq* geocoding API
* `forecast_token` - Using *forecast.io* weather API

Currently `discord.py` only supports python 3.4-3.6 due to `async` support.

***Note:*** This is an active project with many features unimplemented or to be improved.
